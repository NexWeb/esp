            <!--
            <p>ESP is provided in two supported versions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>ESP Long Term Support (LTS)</b> &mdash; The goal of LTS versions is stability and compatibility. 
                Bugs and security issues will be fixed, but no feature updates will be issued for LTS versions. 
                ESP 4.5.X is head of the LTS stream and it will be maintained with security updates and fixes until 
                the end of 2015.</li>
                <li><b>ESP Development Versions (DEV)</b> &mdash; The goal of DEV versions is ongoing feature development. 
                New features will be issued for DEV versions and APIs will evolve. ESP 5 is the next DEV version and it 
                will be released in Q1 2014.</li>
            </ul>
            -->
            <p>ESP APIs may evolve between minor releases. The ESP documentation
            provides a <a href="stability.html">Stability Classification</a> for each API 
            group that reflects their stability with respect to forward changes.</p>
            
            <h2>Migrating to ESP from Appweb</h2>
            <p>ESP 1.X is mostly compatible with ESP in Appweb 4.X. Code written for Appweb 4.X 
            ESP should migrate to ESP with some changes.</p>

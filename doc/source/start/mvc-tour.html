            <h1>ESP MVC Tour</h1>
            <p>This quick tour of the ESP MVC Framework provides an overview of the ESP generator for 
            Model-View-Controller applications. The generated application will use the 
            <em>esp-html-skeleton</em> Pak which provides a server-side MVC framework.</p>
            <p>Before starting, first make sure you have read the <a href="quick.html">Quick Start</a>,
            and the <a href="tour.html">ESP Tour</a> and that you have ESP installed on your system so you
            can type along as you go. This tour uses the <em><a href="../users/program.html">esp</a></em> application
            generator.</p>
            <a id="blog"></a>
            <h2 >Creating a New Application</h2>
            <p>To create a new ESP application, you will use <em>esp</em>, the ESP application generator
            program. Make a directory named <em>blog</em> and then install the esp-html-skeleton Pak.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment"><b>$ mkdir blog
$ cd blog
$ pak install esp-html-skeleton</b>
   [Install] esp-server 5.3.0
   [Install] esp-mvc 5.3.0
   [Install] esp-html-skeleton 5.3.0
</pre>
            <p>This simple command accomplished quite a bit, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Create a core structure with directories for various parts of the application. Initially, some of
                    these directories are empty, but they will be used as your application grows.</li>
                <li><p>Installed the esp-html-skeleton, esp-mvc and esp-server Paks. You can see these via
                    the <em>pak list</em> command.</p>
                <li>Created <em>esp.json</em> and <em>package.json</em> files that configures and control how your application will run.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conventions</h2>
            <p>The ESP web framework follows the <i>"convention over
            configuration"</i> philosophy popularized by <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
            means that ESP adopts certain conventions about where files and directories should be placed and about
            how names are used. If you work with these conventions, then you need to do little or no configuration.
            Things will just work.</p>
            <p>Here are the most important directories:</p>
            <table title="directories" class="ui table segment">
                <thead>
                    <tr>

                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>See the "<a href="../users/program.html">esp</a>" command documentation for an explanation 
            of the other generated directories.</p>
            
            <a id="run"></a>
            <h2 >Access your Application</h2>
            <p>To access your application enter <em>http://localhost:4000</em> in your browser. 
            You should see your first application home page.</p>

            <h2>Scaffolds</h2>
            <p>Scaffolding is a quick way to generate pieces of your application. Once the <em>esp-html-skeleton</em> framework
            pak is installed, the <em>esp</em> command can generate
            database tables, views and controllers for you. The command below will create a <em>post</em> database table
            with a blog post title and post comment body. The <em>title</em> is a string data type and the <em>body</em> is a
            multi-line text field.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
$ <b>esp generate scaffold post title:string body:text</b>

</pre>
            <p>This command created:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A server-side post Controller (post.c)</li>
                <li>Server-side HTML views for listing posts (post-list) and editing posts (post-edit).</li>
                <li>A database migration to create the post database table.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The command also run the migration to create the database and table.</p>
            <p>Now if you set your browser to the home page, you will now see an empty listing of blog posts.
            <img src="../images/esp/mvc-tour/post-list.png" alt="postList" class="bare-screen" /> 
            
            <a id="newPosts"></a></p>
            <h2 >Create New Posts</h2>
            <p>The New Post button directs your browser to the <em>/server/post/</em> URI. This form is being
            rendered on the client from the client/app/post/post-edit.html template. Behind the scenes, the 
            browser asks for the <em>/server/post/init</em> URI to determine what are the required input fields 
            for a post.</p>
            <img src= "../images/esp/mvc-tour/create.png" alt="createPost" class="bare-screen" />
            <p>Fill in the input fields and click OK to add the new blog post.</p>
            
            <img src= "../images/esp/mvc-tour/post-list-2.png" alt="postList" class="bare-screen" />
            <p>The home page is now updated with the first post.  You can click on the post title or body
            to edit its contents. This will run the same post-edit.html template that was used to create the post.</p>
            <h2 class=section>On the Server</h2>
            <p>When <em>OK</em> button is clicked to create a post, the browser invokes the
            <em>/server/post</em> URI with the HTTP "POST" method to create the blog post. The Appweb server
            parses this URI and and selects the appropriate request route and handler for the request. It 
            then identifies <em>post</em> as the name of the server-side controller invokes the <em>createPost</em>
            action routine to service the request. The controller is automatically compiled and loaded if required.
            <p>A controller file typically defines many such C functions called actions, that are bound to specific URIs
            via Appweb routes. Actions are defined using the <em>espDefineAction</em> API in the initialization 
            function of the controller.</p>
            <p>A minimal post controller file looks like this:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
#include "esp.h"
static void createPost() { 
    EdiRec *rec = createRec("post", params());
    renderResult(updateRec(rec));
}
ESP_EXPORT int esp_controller_blog_post(EspRoute *eroute) 
{
    espDefineAction(route, "post-create", createPost);
    return 0;
}
</pre>
            <h3>Actions</h3>
            <p>The job of the action is to respond to the request and generate the response via views for the
            client. Here is the <em>list</em> action in the generated <em>post</em> controller.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
static void listPost() { 
    renderGrid(readTable("post"));
}
</pre>
            <p>The <em>list</em> action reads the post table and then renders the table data and schema as a JSON
            response. The client interprets this JSON data an applies it to the client-side model. The Aurelia
            client Javascript framework uses this model and "data-binding" to paste the data, 
            somewhat auto-magically into the HTML page. </p>
            
            <h2>Code Errors</h2>
            <p>What happens if you make a mistake entering the embedded "C" code in your controller or in an ESP web page. 
            Say you forgot the semicolon in the last example. You will see an error like this in your browser:</p>
            <img src="../images/esp/mvc-tour/error.png" alt="homeLink" class="bare-screen" /> 
            <p>If you look in the appweb console log, you will see details about the request that failed.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">

            <a id="validations">
            </a>
            <h2 >Validations</h2>
            <p>Complete validation of all user entered data is essential for a robust and secure application. The 
            validation may be performed at the client, but must also always be fully implemented on the server incase
            the client or network connection is compromised. ESP provides flexible validation methods to help 
            ensure the data you save at the server is correct.</p>
            <p>You can add calls to validate record data before it is saved to the database. To do this, edit the
            <em>controllers/post.c</em> file and add calls to <a 
            href="../ref/api/edi.html#group___edi_1ga64cb0410a70843250c9826e8d12e3944">ediAddValidation</a>.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
ESP_EXPORT int esp_controller_post(EspRoute *eroute, MprModule *module) 
{
    <b>Edi *edi;</b>
    /* Existing code */
    <b>edi = getDatabase();
    ediAddValidation(edi, "present", "post", "title", 0);
    ediAddValidation(edi, "present", "post", "body", 0);
    ediAddValidation(edi, "unique", "post", "title", 0);</b>
    return 0;
}
</pre>
            <p>This will cause the database to automatically ensure that the <em>title</em> and <em>body</em> fields are
            not blank and that the <em>title</em> is unique in the post database table.</p>
           
            <p>If you click OK in the Post <em>edit</em> web page without entering any data
            you will see the following:</p>
            
            <img src="../images/esp/mvc-tour/validate.png" alt="validate" class="bare-screen" />
            <p>This automatically identified the input fields in error and generated a summary of the errors above the
            form. Of course, this default error highlighting behavior can be overridden if desired by modifying the
            application style sheets.<p>
           
            <p>Other validation types include: checkNumber, checkBoolean, checkDate and checkFormat.
            You can also define new validation types by calling 
            <a href="../ref/api/edi.html#group___edi_service_1ga889df64bdd239f71c66b4fa920be8f46">ediDefineValidation</a>.

            <a id="homePage"></a>
            <h2>Edit the Home Page</h2>
            <p>ESP applications based on single-page client Javascript frameworks like 
                <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular</a> or <a href="http://aurelia.io">Aurelia</a>
            use a single home page that applies different view templates 
            to modify the content. Consequently, the index.esp home page is typically also the master 
            application layout page. Modifying index.esp will modify all the views presented to the client.</p>

            <h1>ESP Model-View-Controller Framework</h1>
            <p>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm is a design pattern for creating and managing applications. It
            partitions the separate concerns of application data, application logic and user interface into three
            discrete components. It has proven to be highly successful in simplifying application design and
            maintenance.</p>
            
            <img src="../../../images/mvc.jpg" alt="mvc" class="centered" />
            <p>The ESP Web Framework supports the Model-View-Controller pattern to enable the creation of ESP MVC
            applications. But it also permits you to use each component separately so that you can have stand-alone
            controllers, views or database models. This flexibility allows you to pick and choose the components you
            need or to embrace the entire MVC paradigm.</p>
            <p>Further, you can choose to create and render the views in the browser using a client-side 
            Javascript MVC framework like <a href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a>.</p>
            
            <a id="models"></a>
            <h2>Models</h2>
            <p>The model is responsible for managing access to application data and state. It is also responsible for
            ensuring the data remains valid and consistent.</p>
            <p>ESP provides a basic Object Relational Mapper (ORM) via the Embedded Database Interface (EDI).
            This wraps database data in a "C" language Record and Grid data structure. It then allows you to use
            object-oriented programming (OOP) when dealing with database data stored in rows and columns. </p>
            
            <a id="views"></a>
            <h2>Views</h2>
            <p>The view is responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting the application to the user.
            Views should not manage incoming requests &mdash; that is the job of Controllers.</p>
            <p>ESP provides the ESP web pages to assist in creating view web pages. ESP web pages are HTML
            pages with embedded "C" code. They are compiled and run to render the user interface. The ESP view 
            mechanism also provides a templating engine so you can deal separately with layout pages and content pages.</p>
            
            <a id="controllers"></a>
            <h2>Controllers</h2>
            <p>Controllers manage the application and respond to client requests. They orchestrate the application's
            response, they access and update model data, and display views back to the client. Incoming requests invoke
            <b>Actions</b> in the controller which modify the application state and ultimately render a view.</p>
            <p>ESP controllers are "C" source files with one C function per action. Requests are routed by ESP 
                by parsing and decoding request URIs and matching them with the appropriate Controller 
                and Action function.</p>

            <h1>Licensing</h1>
            <p>This page outlines the requirements of the ESP open source license and the options for
            a commercial license. Please note, this text only provides a guideline. You must consult the actual licenses
            for details of the governing terms.
            </p>
            <p>ESP is provided under an open source license. This license is the GNU license governed by
            the provisions of the <a href="gpl.html">GPL</a> license. This GPL license should meet your needs if you work for 
            a non-profit or educational institution. The GPL can also work well for evaluation within your company.
            
            For commercial applications, we recommend a Commercial License. If you require a commercial license or
            commercial support for ESP, please see <a href="#commercial">Commercial License</a> below or contact <a href=
            "http://embedthis.com">Embedthis Software</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="section">Open Source License</h2>
            <p>The <a href="gpl.html">ESP GPL license</a> is ideal for integrating with other GPL software, internal
            use and evaluation.</p>
            <a id="gpl"></a>
            <h3>Use with Other GPL Software</h3>
            <p>If you are using ESP and your ESP application is 100% GPL or
            is licensed under an Open Source License that is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses">OSI</a>
            approved and acceptable to Embedthis Software, you may use ESP with the GPL license. 
            You do not need any other agreement or license &mdash; the GPL is all you
            require.</p><a id="nonGpl"></a>
            <h3>Embedding with Non-GPL Software</h3>
            <p>If you do not wish to publish your source code
            under under an Open Source License that is <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses">OSI</a> approved
            and acceptable to Embedthis Software, and you wish to redistribute your application, then you will need a
            <a href="#commercial">commercial license</a>.</p>
            <a id="download"></a>
            <h3>ESP Download Package</h3>
            <p>With the ESP download, you will receive binaries, source code, samples and documentation and you need
            not pay any license fees. However, you must abide by all the provisions of the GPL. If you intend to redistribute your 
            software and link ESP with your application, the GPL requires you to provide documentation and all source code
            on a nondiscriminatory basis.
            If you do not wish to
            provide source code to your application, you must purchase a <a href="#commercial">commercial license</a>
            (see below for details).</p>
            <p>Note that under the GPL license, you may develop, evaluate, and embed ESP in your
            application or product provided it is not redistributed, either internally or externally. You may copy and
            modify the source code provided all copies fall under the GPL license.</p>
            <h2><a id="commercial"></a>Commercial License</h2>
            <p>You will need a commercial license if you distribute your ESP application and you do not wish
            to distribute your software under anapproved open source license. 
            A commercial license includes the added benefits of support services and priority notifications.
            
            In summary, there are several good reasons to purchase a commercial license:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You require the ability to redistribute your product including ESP.</li>
                <li>You do not want to provide non-discriminatory access to the source code for your application.</li>
                <li>You need a warranty on Embedthis software (see license for details).</li>
                <li>You do not want to run the risk of your organization's software falling under the governing terms
                    of the GPL.</li>
                <li>You need support services.</li>
                <li>You want priority notification of updates, upgrades, security issues and emergency patches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Production Deployment</h3>
            <p>For deployment in a production environment, it optimal to compile the entire application including
            all controllers, views and web pages into a single library. This is refered to as "combined" mode.
            The normal mode is called "discrete" mode. To do a combined compile, set the <em>esp.combine</em>
                property in <em>esp.json</em> to true, and then invoke <em>esp compile</em>. For example:</p>

            <code class="inverted">esp: {
    combine: true
}</code>

            <h1>Creating ESP Applications</h1>
            <a id="creating"></a>
            <p>To start a new ESP web application or web site, first create a new directory named for the 
            application, then run <em>esp init</em>.</p>
            <code class="inverted">$ mkdir demo
$ cd demo
$ <b>esp init</b></code>
            <p>This will prepare your application to run ESP by generating two configuration files and 
            creating a <em>dist</em> directory to hold your rendered application.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <em>package.json</em> file to describe the name and version of your application 
                    with any installed packages.</li>
                <li>The <em>esp.json</em> file to configure ESP and HTTP.</li>
                <li>The <em>dist</em> directory is the final distribution directory for web content 
                    after rendering.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You can now create web pages to be served by ESP. Create a test ESP page under the <em>dist</em>
            directory called <em>dist/index.esp</em> with the contents:</p>
            <code class="inverted">&lt;html>
&lt;body>
    &lt;h1>Hello World&lt;/h1>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code>

            <p>If a directory named <em>dist</em> is not present, <em>esp</em> will serve web content from the
            current directory. It is more secure to have only the public web documents being visible in a
            <em>dist</em> directory.</p> 

            <a id="running"></a>
            <h2>Running</h2>
            <p>To run your application, run <em>esp serve</em> to serve browser requests.</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp serve</b></pre>
            <p>You can also just run a plain <em>esp</em> command without arguments. It is the same
            as <em>esp serve</em>.</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp</b></pre>

            <p>You can now browse to <em>http://localhost:4000/index.esp</em> to see the new page.
            The first time, there will be a brief pause as the page is compiled and saved in the
            <em>cache</em> directory. Next time, the page will be served from memory. 
            If you modify the page, it will be transparently re-compiled. If you restart <em>esp</em> the cached
            module will be loaded and the page will not be re-compiled.</p>

            <h2>Skeletons</h2>
            <p>There is another way to create ESP applications and that is by installing ESP <em>skeletons</em>. 
            Skeletons are integrated starting packages for ESP applications. Skeletons typically include starter 
            web pages, layouts, partial pages, stylesheets, scripts and required dependent packages for an easy, 
            one-step launch of your web application. For example, to install the <em>esp-skeleton</em>:</p>

            <code class="inverted">$ pak install esp-skeleton
   [Install] exp-js 0.2.0
   [Install] exp-less 0.2.0
   [Install] exp-css 0.2.0
   [Install] exp-esp 0.1.0
   [Install] esp-skeleton 5.4.0</code>

            <p>This installs the <em>esp-skeleton</em> for an ESP application and includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A default layout page <em>layouts/default.html.exp</em></li>
                <li>Partial pages for page headers, footers and navigation: <em>partials/header.html.exp</em>, <em>partials/footer.html.exp</em> and <em>partials/nav.html.exp</em></li>
                <li>Less stylesheet <em>contents/app.less</em></li>
                <li><a href="https://embedthis.com/expansive/">Expansive</a> plugins to manage 
                    Javscripts, Less and CSS stylesheets, and the <em>exp-esp</em> plugin to 
                    compile ESP pages and run ESP applications.</li> 
            </ul>
            <p>To render and server pages, run: <em>expansive</em>.</p>
            <pre class="code">$ expansive</pre>

            <p>Read more about skeletons in <a href="skeletons.html">Application Skeletons</a>.</p>

            <h2>Configuration Files</h2>
            <p>The two generated configuration files <em>package.json</em> and <em>esp.json</em>, play a central
            role in configuring and managing the evolution of your application. If you install a skeleton,
            you may also have created an <em>expansive.json</em> file to manage Expansive. Read more about 
            these files in <a href="configuring.html">Configuring ESP</a>.</p>

            <h2>Directories</h2>
            <p>The <em>esp init</em> and <em>pak</em> commands will make directories as required when creating
            an application or installing packages and generating components.</p>

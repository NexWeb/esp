            <h1>Building ESP Applications</h1>
            <a id="compiling"></a>
            <p>ESP builds applications, pages and controllers into native machine code libraries. These are automatically
            compiled in response to client requests and are then loaded and run by ESP to serve the relevant 
            response. Code is compiled only once but can be run many times to service incoming requests.</p>

            <p>ESP will automatically recompile controllers, and web pages if the source is modified. However, 
            you can explicitly pre-compile portions or the complete application via the <em>esp</em> command.</p>

            <h3>Compile the Application</h3>
            <p>The <em>esp</em> command can simply ompile the entire application via <em>esp compile</em>.</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp compile</b></pre>

            <p>This will compile and link all controllers and pages and save the generated shared libraries (DLLs)
            in the <em>cache</em> directory.</p>

            <p>If <em>esp compile</em> is run with one or more paths on the command line, these paths will act as 
            filters such that only the designated paths will be compiled. For example:</p>

            <pre class="code">
$ <b>esp compile web/test.esp</b>
$ <b>esp compile myapp</b>
$ <b>esp compile views</b>
$ <b>esp compile /path/to/my/app</b>
$ <b>esp compile /directory/of/apps</b>
</pre>
            <p>These paths are interpreted as filenames relative to the current directory.
            If a controller, web page filename is provided, only that resource will be compiled. If a directory that 
            is part of an MVC application is provided, then all resources under that directory will be compiled. 
            If a directory that is a parent directory of ESP applications or web pages, then all those
            resources contained by that directory will be compiled.</p>

            <p>You may also use the <em>--routeName</em> or <em>--routePrefix</em> switches to select a specific ESP route
            Then only the resources managed by that route will be compiled.</p>

            <h3>Custom Compiler Options</h3>
            <p>If you have custom compiler flags or libraries, you can pass these to <em>esp</em> by defining the CFLAGS
            environment variable. For example:</p>

            <pre class="code">$ CFLAGS="-DMY_MODE=test -lmylib" <b>esp compile</b></pre>

            <h3>Static Linking</h3>
            <p>When using dynamic linking, ESP automatically invokes the necessary initializers when running
            ESP pages or invoking ESP controllers. However, if you are using static linking, you need to take some
            extra manual steps. If you are using static linking, use the <em>--static</em> switch to generate 
            archive libraries instead of shared libraries. You must then manually call the ESP initializers for pages
            and controllers. You can generate the necessary initialization calls via the esp <em>--genlink
            slink.c</em> switch. The generated code should be linked with your main program replacing the default
            slink.c file.</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp --static --genlink slink.c</b></pre>
-->

            <a id="rules"></a>
            <h2>Compilation Rules</h2>
            <p>ESP includes a pre-configured set of compilation commands for major operating systems. 
            These are represented as compile and link templates in the <em>esp-compile.json</em>. This file is   
            located at <em>/usr/local/lib/esp/bin</em> on Unix or on Windows at 
            <em>C:/Program Files/Embedthis ESP/bin</em>. For example:</p>

            <pre class="code">
{
    macosx: {
        compile: '${CC} -c ${DEBUG} -Wall -DPIC -fPIC -arch &rarr;
                  ${GCC_ARCH} -I. -I${APPINC} -I${INC} ${SRC} -o ${OBJ}'
    }
}
</pre>
            <p>The various tokens in braces <em>${token}</em>, are expanded at runtime. The <em>esp-compile.json</em>
            configuration file has conditional sections for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and VxWorks.
            You can customize this file to suit your system. </p>

            <h3>Keep Source</h3>
            <p>When compiling ESP pages, the <em>http.keep</em> configuration file directive will control
            if the intermediate C source code generated from the ESP will 
            be preserved.  This can sometimes be helpful for debugging. 
            You also keep the generated source via the <em>esp --keep compile</em> option.</p> 
            
            <a name="cross"></a>
            <h2>Cross Compilation</h2>
            <p>When cross-compiling, invoke the <em>esp</em> command with the <em>--config</em> switch to specify a
            separate compilation rule file for compiling on the target. Copy the standard <em>esp-compile.json</em> 
            and modify the compile and link targets as required.</p>

            <p>When <em>esp compile</em> is invoked, it selects its compile and link rules from the 
            <em>esp-compile.json</em> configuration file. This file, which may be customized, contains 
            the rules for various operating systems and CPU architectures.</p>

            <p>If cross-compiling, the configuration for the target host specified via the ESP <em>configure</em> program 
            is utilized.</p>

            <p>The <em>esp</em> command can select alternate compile and link configurations via the 
            <em>--platform</em> switch. For example:</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp --platform vxworks-arm-debug compile</b></pre>

            <p>This will compile the application for VxWorks on arm. Of course, the resulting module cannot be 
            run on the development system if cross-compiling. 
            
            <p>The --platform option will search the current directory and parent directories for an ESP 
            platform directory of the same name. You can provide a full path name as an argument to the 
            --platform switch if your application is outside the ESP source tree.</p>
            
            <p>Note: You may need to modify the <em>esp-compile.json</em> configuration file
            to add rules for your operating system and CPU architecture or to customize for your application.</p>

            <a id="cleaning"></a>
            <h2>Cleaning</h2>
            <p>To clean all generated files under the cache directory:</p>

            <pre class="code">$ <b>esp clean</b></pre>
